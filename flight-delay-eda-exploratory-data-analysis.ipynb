If carriers allowed aircrafts a higher speed and fuel consumption on planes that departed late, the effect wouldn't spread along the flight chain. This would decrease the NAS Delay itself and the Late Aircraft Delay, decreasing significatively the number of planes delayed. \n#### Find the full article [here](https://www.forbes.com/sites/currentaccounts/2017/03/23/air-traffic-control-is-not-the-real-cause-of-airline-delays/#33bb6ca2c375):\n\n### 5.2 Better information efficiency\n#### Amadeus, top GDS (Global Distribution Systems) and IT solutions provider to the travel industry identifies the approaches that Airlines, IT solutions and Big Data are taking in order to solve this issue.
